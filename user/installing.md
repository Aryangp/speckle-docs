## System Wide Installations

By default Manager installs Connectors on Windows under the *local user app data folder*, if you would like to install it for every user on a machine, or roll it out company-wide, we have made things simpler!

::: tip NOTE
We are rolling out this functionality to more connectors, currently it's only been added in Revit, Rhino and Grasshopper
:::

1. To do so, first download the individual exe for manual installation from our [‚¨áÔ∏è Releases Website](https://speckle-releases.netlify.app/)
2. If you are running the installer manually, you'll no see a dialog prompting you to choose local (Install for me only) or system wide (Install for all users - requires admin privileges) options.

3. If you are running the installer programmatically, you can instead use the following command-line arguments:
    - `/SILENT` and `/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES` for a background installation
    - `/ALLUSERS` or `/CURRENTUSER` for a system or local installation
4. *IMPORTANT:* Local and system installations should not be mixed as it could cause issues.
